title: Third Party App Developer Agreement
---
Groupcall Limited is committed to raising the standards of privacy and security applied to the management of education data, and we know our partners share this commitment. Therefore, we have created this Developer Agreement, which sets out a range of commitments that both Groupcall Limited and our Third Party Developer partners agree constitute good practice. You should also read this document in conjunction with our Glossary of Terms.

We’ve tried to keep this agreement as readable and user-friendly as possible. We have, however, stuck to some conventional legal document practices (such as capitalisation of ‘You’ and ‘Us’ in relation to each party) where it’s helpful for clarity.

## Who do these terms apply to?

This agreement is between You, a Third Party Developer and Xporter on Demand Partner, and Groupcall Limited. If you do not, or cannot, agree to these terms you should not use the Xporter on Demand platform.

## Our commitment to You

Groupcall Limited are committed to providing the highest quality tools for the purposes of education and school improvement. Therefore, with respect to data security and privacy, we will not ask you to accept anything that we ourselves are unable to accept. Like you, we agree to comply with the Data Security and Privacy Pledge below. Our Terms of Service incorporate the standards outlined in the pledge, as well as additional commitments that we make to schools.

## Your commitment to Groupcall Limited 

As an Xporter on Demand Partner, You agree to comply with the following pledge at all times:

* Adhere strictly to the terms of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and any future amendments or applicable legislation.

* Only store and process the minimum data required to provide our services

* Comply with all Subject Access Requests made against the data stored
* Ensure that all staff spending time in schools hold a valid Disclosure and Barring Service certificate

* Delete personal data where no longer required to provide the service explicitly offered to schools, or where requested by a Data Controller
* Always maintain adequate liability insurance
* Audit our services against this pledge periodically and provide evidence of compliance to the other party whenever requested
* Report any significant breaches of security to our users, each-other, and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and other authorities without undue delay and within 72 hours
* Make Terms of Service and Privacy Policies clearly, and publicly, available on our websites
* Ensure that all employees and subcontractors are aware of, and abide by, this agreement and all applicable Terms of Service and Privacy Policies

**Groupcall Limited and You both agree NOT to:**

* Store or transport personal or sensitive data outside of the EEA or outside of countries which are granted to have Adequate Levels of Protection as defined by the European Commission
* Use the school data made available via the Xporter on Demand platform for the purposes of advertising or marketing, or for any purpose other than the service explicitly provided to schools, or where agreed by schools on a case by case basis

* Access, attempt to access, or inspect any data without the Data Controller’s express permission
* Claim ownership or exclusive rights over any of the data processed or created as part of services provided to schools
